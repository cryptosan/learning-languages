## *Who is Beginner*

* Make a boyfriend/girlfriend/native-speaker-friends, you can improve your Grammar/Speaking/Listening more quickly than anyone.  
* Read your Grammar book loudly, again and again.. at least 5 times.  
* Don't match word-by-word in English.  
  (e.g: 은/는 equals *am/are/is*, it's not a good way)
* Learn words with graphics by phrases, like below:  
  저는/나는(I'm) ~에 가는 중/가고 있어/가고 있습니다.(going to *place*)  
  **Learn with graphics!**
* Study everyday/everywhere/every time, watch K-Drama, listen to Kpop, look for your hobbies, **enjoy to learn Korean**
